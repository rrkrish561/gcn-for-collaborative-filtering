First, ensure that the epinions dataset (linked in the report) is downloaded and installed in a directory called '''data'''. 

# NCF Model

Running the NCF model is as simple as running the '''ncf_ratings_prediction.ipynb''' Jupyter Notebook once all packages are installed. This will run the preprocessing pipeline and then subsequently run the training and testing experiments.

# GraphRec Model
To run the GraphRec model, first ensure that PyG is installed. Likewise, simply run the '''gncf.ipynb''' notebook to run all training and testing experiments.
